This (private) repository holds a mirror of the analysis files for the paper *Paleontological baselines for evaluating contemporary extinction risk in the coastal oceans* by Seth Finnegan, Sean C. Anderson, Paul G. Harnik, Carl Simpson, Derek P. Tittensor, Jarrett E. Byrnes, Zoe V. Finkel, David R. Lindberg, Lee Hsiang Liow, Rowan Lockwood, Heike K. Lotze, Craig M. McClain, Jenny L. McGuire, Aaron O'Dea, and John M. Pandolfi.

This work is a product of the Determinants of Extinction in Ancient and Modern Seas Working Group supported by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center, NSF #EF-0905606.

The in-progress Supporting Material document (which also reproduces the analyses) can be found in the `analysis` folder.

Enable the `Soft wrap` option:

Now edit!

Or, you might find the "Zen Mode" easier to work in. Click this button:

You'll now get a simplified editor that looks like this:

When you're done, (first exit Zen Mode if you're in it) head to the bottom of the page, enter a short message describing your changes, and click the `Commit changes` button:

It's best if you make a number of incremental edits and commits. This makes the version history easier to follow, reduces the chances you'll try and edit the same line as someone else at the same time, and reduces the chances of losing your work before saving.
