This (private) repository holds a mirror of the analysis files for the paper *Paleontological baselines for evaluating contemporary extinction risk in the coastal oceans* by Seth Finnegan, Sean C. Anderson, Paul G. Harnik, Carl Simpson, Derek P. Tittensor, Jarrett E. Byrnes, Zoe V. Finkel, David R. Lindberg, Lee Hsiang Liow, Rowan Lockwood, Heike K. Lotze, Craig M. McClain, Jenny L. McGuire, Aaron O'Dea, and John M. Pandolfi.

This work is a product of the Determinants of Extinction in Ancient and Modern Seas Working Group supported by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center, NSF #EF-0905606.

All analysis files are in the `r` folder for version control tracking. This folder contains many now-unused files and may be eventually cleaned up. Also, eventually, reasonably small and processed datasets may be placed in a `data` folder.
