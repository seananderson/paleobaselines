# TODO

- [x] move the class mapping code over to a function (hotspots one is done)
- [ ] then start cranking out class and overall sensitivity analysis maps, starting with what we had and probably toggling some other options too
- [x] fixing the real figure 1
- [ ] adding a colour scale to figure 3
- [ ] filling in bits of text in that document
- [ ] drafting up a bit about the interpolation scheme, interspersing some of the figures I made before to explain it
- [ ] integrate upstream code once I have it
