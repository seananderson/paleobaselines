# TODO

[x] move the class mapping code over to a function (hotspots one is done)

[ ] then start cranking out class and overall sensitivity analysis maps, starting with what we had and probably toggling some other options too

[ ] fixing the real figure 1

[ ] adding a colour scale to figure 3

[ ] filling in bits of text in that document

[ ] drafting up a bit about the interpolation scheme, interspersing some of the figures I made before to explain it

[ ] once you get me the upstream code, integrating that... even if you just send me pseudo code with descriptions, I can work with that
